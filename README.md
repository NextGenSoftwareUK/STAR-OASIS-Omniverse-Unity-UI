## Do You Want To Get Involved?

We are always looking for people to jump in and get involved, you do not need to be an existing coder, we can help you with that... you just need a willingness to learn and to have an open heart, we are always more interested with what is in your heart rather than your head! ;-)

The whole world is the Our World team, hence the name... ;-) It is not our project; it is all of humanities...

We also offer FREE training and apprenticeship program with the NextGen Developer Training Programmes.  We will teach you all we know over time and you get to work on this real live commercial codebase rather than wasting time working on throw away dummy apps as most training offers. No previous skills/experience required and is open to everyone, but especially for all disadvantaged people including special needs, homeless, unemployed, prison inmates, kids on the streets etc. We want to help the people the world has forgotten and for people who have stopped believing in themselves, we **BELIEVE IN YOU** and in time you will again too. Everyone has a gift for the world, and we will help you find yoursâ€¦ Find out more by checking out the links below:

We are looking for Web Devs (with any of these: react, angular, vue, js, html, css), Unity Devs & C# Devs.

If anyone is interested in developing this game/platform, then we would LOVE to hear from you! ðŸ˜Š There will be opportunities for people to own shares and/or cryptocurrency (as well as other unique perks such as premium locations in both the geolocation and VR versions, personal or business service spotlights, free lifetime access to all premium paid services, massive karma points (allowing your avatar to progress to more advanced stages in the game unlocking new exciting quests, areas to explore & new special abilities/superpowers) plus lots more!) based on the input they are willing to provide.  

Thank you and we hope we find interest from people to join us on this exciting incredible journey.
